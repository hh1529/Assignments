# 12 Write a Python program to copy the contents of a file to another file. 
# Open the file "harsh.txt" in read mode ("r")
file=open("harsh.txt","r")
# we created a variable "k"
k=""
# we get the data of file using loop into a "j" variable
for j in file:
    # now append or add the data into "k" Name variable
    k+=j
    # print the k
print(k)
# closing  The File
file.close()
# Open the file "python.txt" in append mode ("a")
file=open("python.txt","a")
# writing in the file "python.txt"
file.write("\n")
file.write(k)
# closing The file
file.close()
# Open the file "python.txt" in read mode ("r")
file=open("python.txt","r")
# print and read lines from python.txt
print(file.readlines())
# closing The File
file.close()
